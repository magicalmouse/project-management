# Job Application Edit Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to edit their job applications by clicking the pencil icon in the job applications table. When clicked, it opens a modal dialog similar to the interview modal, allowing users to view and edit application details.

## Implementation Details

### New Components Created

#### 1. Job Application Modal (`src/pages/user/project-list/job-application-modal.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Provides a form interface for editing job application details
- **Features**:
  - Edit company name, job link, job position, resume, cover letter
  - Update application status (Applied, Interviewing, Offered, Rejected)
  - Form validation with required fields
  - Responsive design with grid layout
  - Loading states during save operations

### Updated Components

#### 1. Project List Page (`src/pages/user/project-list/index.tsx`)
- **Changes**:
  - Added import for `JobApplicationModal`
  - Added state management for the job application modal
  - Added `handleEditJob` function to open the edit modal
  - Connected pencil icon button to the edit handler
  - Added the modal component to the JSX

#### 2. Entity Types (`src/types/entity.ts`)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `status?: string` field to `ProposalInfo` interface

### Backend Support
The backend already supports the status field:
- Database schema includes `status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'applied'` in the proposals table
- Backend controllers handle status field in create/update operations
- API service properly transforms status field between frontend and backend

## Usage

1. Navigate to the "My Job Applications" page
2. Find the job application you want to edit
3. Click the pencil icon in the Actions column
4. The job application modal will open with current values pre-filled
5. Make your changes to any field
6. Click "Update Application" to save changes
7. The table will refresh to show the updated information

## Features

### UI/UX

## Technical Notes

### Data Flow
1. User clicks pencil icon â†’ `handleEditJob` function called
2. JobApplication data converted to ProposalInfo format
3. Modal opens with pre-filled form data
